## Project Title: 
'Trader’s Eye' , A Complete, Robust AI Chain Comprising of Vision Model, Agent, and Prediction Model

## Abstract: 
The project ‘Trader's Eye' aims to develop a complete and intelligent AI pipeline designed to analyze stock market graphs and forecast future trends. The system will begin by using a powerful vision model to interpret stock chart images, extracting meaningful patterns and visual cues. This information will then be passed to an agent powered by a large language model, which will reason over the data and contextualize it within market dynamics. Finally, a prediction model will generate short-term projections, offering insights into potential future movements of the stock.
The vision model in Trader’s Eye serves as the first step in analyzing stock charts by focusing on visual elements such as price movements, candlestick patterns, and trend lines. Using deep learning and computer vision techniques, it extracts essential data that helps identify recurring patterns in stock behavior. This model can process vast amounts of chart images quickly, providing a clear understanding of past trends. By doing so, it lays the foundation for a data-driven approach to stock market forecasting. The extracted insights are pivotal for accurately interpreting the stock's visual history.
Thereafter, the agent emerges, an agent which is driven by a large language model that is intended to reason over the information collected by the vision model. It puts into perspective the chart patterns gleaned by looking at wider variables such as history, tone of the market and news in real time. Through sophisticated natural language processing, the agent recognizes possible correlations and causative relationships between events in a market and the movement of stock price. It carries out continuous analyses and adjusts accordingly depending on a changing market environment. This would make the system flexible in providing valuable consideration to the performance of the stock.
The prediction model is the final stage, where all the insights gathered from the vision model and agent are used to project short-term stock trends. By utilizing time series analysis, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models, the prediction model generates forecasts for future stock behavior. It considers past performance and real-time data to create accurate short-term projections. These predictions are invaluable for traders, offering timely insights that can guide their investment decisions. Together, the combined functionality of vision, reasoning, and prediction enhances the accuracy and relevance of the system’s forecasts.
